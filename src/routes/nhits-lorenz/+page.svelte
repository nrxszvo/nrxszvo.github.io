			This project is inspired by several recent publications involving the use of deep
			learning to predict or control chaotic dynamical systems, in particular William Gilpin's
			paper, <i
				>Model scale versus domain knowledge in statistical forecasting of chaotic systems</i
			>
			<Ref id="gilpin" />. Gilpin found that, given enough training data, generic neural
			architectures can match or exceed the performance of state-of-the-art domain-specific
			chaotic forecasting models such as reservoir computers and neural ODEs. I have recently
			become intrigued by the prospect of applying deep learning to prediction tasks involving
			chaotic systems, as I explore ways to contribute to the efforts to find technical
			solutions to climate change, and Gilpin's paper provided the impetus for me to begin
			this investigation. Along with <Ref id="gilpin" />, several other recent publications in
			related areas have been especially exciting to me, particularly the ones applying deep
			learning to tokamak control in nuclear fusion reactors (see e.g. <Ref id="seo" />, <Ref
				id="degrave"
			/>)<sup><a href="#sabine">1</a></sup>.
		</P><P
			>My goal with this project is to get some hands-on experience with a chaotic system and
			probe deeper into Gilpin's findings by testing the limits of a generic (<i>i.e.</i>
			non-physics-informed) neural network's ability to model a single chaotic system (within the
			computational constraints imposed by my budget<sup><a href="#paperspace">2</a></sup>).
			I'll start with what is probably the most well known chaotic system, the Lorenz
			Attractor. I will approach the problem more from the perspective of a generalist deep
			learning practioner than a dynamical systems expert, so I will be discovering many of
			the properties of the Lorenz System, and dynamical systems in general, as I go, often
			using the results of my experiments to guide my investigation<sup

		<H1 id="nhits">Neural Architecture: N-HiTS</H1>
		<P>
			The N-HiTS <Ref id="challu" /> forecasting network is known to produce state-of-the-art results,
			at the time of writing, for univariate time series prediction, with up to an order of magnitude
			lower computational requirement than some competitors. Given my limited budget and its strong
			performance reported in <Ref id="gilpin" />, it seemed like the natural starting point
			for a network architecture.
		</P>
		<P>
			The architectural ideas in N-HiTS build on those of its predecessor, N-BEATS <Ref
				id="oreshkin"
			/>, a neural basis expansion network for time series prediction. The key ideas inherited
			from N-BEATS include the organization of fully connected layers into blocks that output
			basis expansions (linear projections of the preceding fully connected layer's output)
			and the use of both forecast and backcast predictions from each block. The forecast
			predictions from all blocks are summed together to produce the final output of the
			network, while the backcasts are subtracted from the input of the corresponding block to
			produce a residual connection as the input to the next block. The goal of the backcasts
			is to help the downstream blocks by "removing components of their input that are not
			helpful for forecasting" <Ref id="oreshkin" />.
		</P>
		<P
			>The novel ideas from N-HiTS enable the possiblity of modeling increasingly long time
			horizons while keeping computational complexity low. They include the use of pooling
			layers that downsample the inputs to each block and upsampling layers that map a
			compressed representation of the forecast to the output sample rate. In addition to the
			complexity savings, the compressed representations may induce a bias towards a temporal
			hierarchical modeling of the time series across the blocks that allows N-HiTS to exceed
			the performance of competing long-horizon forecasting models while requiring an order of
			magnitude lower computational complexity <Ref id="challu" />.
		</P>
		<H1 id="experiments">Experiments</H1>
		<P>
			While Gilpin's experiments focus on testing 24 different time-series prediction models
			on over 130 different chaotic systems using a relatively narrow range of hyper
			parameters for tuning <Ref id="gilpin" />, my experiments aim to tune a single model,
			N-HiTS, on a single system, the Lorenz Attractor, to maximize its accuracy for a given,
			relatively long, fixed horizon (aka prediction window length). And more specifically, I
			aim not only to achieve a low average error on the test set but also to limit the
			worst-case error as much as possible, which will likely mean achieving a degree of
			predictive power over the most chaotic regions of the system. Is this a completely naive
			aspiration given what is known about chaotic systems? Maybe, but I'm not really sure
			yet, and either way this should be a great learning experience...
		</P><H2 id="datagen">Data Generation</H2><P
			>I begin with a horizon (prediction window), {`$H$`}, of 100 points, using a {`$dt$`} of

			<i>after</i>
			it is generated by the IVP solver. The actual {`$dt$`} used internally by the IVP solver

			<Link href="https://github.com/williamgilpin/dysts">dysts</Link>, the Lyapunov exponent, {`$\\lambda_{max}$`},

			training sample a total of 600 points. (Note that because N-HiTs is a univariate model,

			point coincides with one of the three <Link
				href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_point_(mathematics)"
				>critical points</Link
			> of the Lorenz system&mdash;in this case, the origin. And in this parameterization, the
			origin is known to be a saddle point comprised of the intersection of a stable 2D manifold
			and an unstable 1D manifold. "Stable" here means that trajectories near the critical point
			tend to move towards it even if they are perturbed slightly away from it by other forces,
			while "unstable" implies the opposite. (See <Ref id="osinga" /> for some excellent visualizations
			of these manifolds.) Near the origin, the unstable manifold is a line that is approximately
			perpendicular to the Z axis and parallel to the lengthwise orientation of the Attractor,
			which is why the trajectories always diverge at the near-90-degree angles that we see in
			the animations as they approach the origin. And the (incredibly complex) topography of the
			stable 2D manifold determines towards which of the other two critical points a trajectory
			will be deflected <Ref id="osinga" />. In fact, we might technically say that the
			primary goal of the neural network is to learn the topography of the origin's stable 2D
			manifold; according to <Ref id="osinga" />, this manifold defines a boundary across
			which trajectories can never pass, so we can confine the past and future path of any
			trajectory based on the boundaries of this manifold.
		</P><P
			>We can estimate how unstable the 1D manifold is by calculating the eigenvalues of the
			Jacobian matrix of the system at the origin and assuming the dynamics are approximately
			linear in this region (see <Link
				href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hartman%E2%80%93Grobman_theorem"
				>Hartman-Grobman Theorem</Link
			>). When we do this, we get three eigenvalues, two of which have negative real
			components and are associated with the stable 2D manifold, and the third which has
			positive real component and is associated with the unstable 1D manifold. The dynamics
			along the manifolds near the origin can be approximated by the expression {`$f(t) = \\exp(\\lambda t)x_0$`},
			where {`$\\lambda$`} equals the eigenvalue and {`$x_0$`} is some initial point. For the Lorenz
			Attractor, the eigenvalue associated with the unstable manifold is {`$\\approx 11.8$`},
			so trajectories will be rapidly deflected away from the origin along the unstable
			manifold, as we see in the below animation:</P

		</P>
		<H3>3.1: Biased Dataset Distribution</H3>
		<P
			>The first idea is to increase the percentage of trajectories in the dataset that pass
			very close to the origin so that the model sees more examples of these very tough cases
			during training. This turns out to be quite tricky task! Emperically, trajectories that
			pass very close to the origin are rare on the attractor, in the sense that just choosing
			a random intial condition from a point within the attractor volume is unlikely to
			produce a trajectory that passes very close to the origin in a relatively short amount
			of time. One idea is to choose a point that is already very close to the origin, and
			then use it as the initial condition to generate both a forward- and a backward-time
			solution. Then we can concatenate the two solutions together to produce a single
			solution with adequate time points before and after it approaches the origin. Sounds
			simple enough, except that when I attempted to produce the backwards solution, I
			inevitably ended up with a trajectory whose X coordinate grows in magnitude
			exponentially. In all of my attempts using the <Link
				href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.integrate.Radau.html"
				>Radau solver</Link
			> with error tolerances approaching the limits of double precision, the X coordinate grew
			to the order of about {`$1\\mathrm{e}{30}$`}
			after about 0.5 seconds.</P
		><P
			>What's going on here? One possible explanation has to do with the finite volume that
			the attractor occupies. When we generate a forward solution starting with a point that
			is already on, or very close to, the attractor, we should be almost guaranteed to end up
			with a trajectory that remains on the attractor as {`$t \\to \\infty$`}, as this is the
			definition of an attractor after all. But the phase space is unbounded, and when we
			generate a backwards time solution, we are choosing a point on some aribtrary trajectory
			from the set of all trajectories in the phase space, including the ones that begin very
			far away from the attractor volume. The probability of randomly selecting a point that
			corresponds with a trajectory that has already been on the attractor for a sufficiently
			long period of time <i>might</i> be very low. However, this theory doesn't seem to

			there is some issue with the numerical stability of the approaches I tried.
		</P><P
			>Failing to employ the backwards-time method, I will resort to cruder methods for
			generating a biased dataset. First I generate a very large number of trajectories (many
			more than I intend to use during training) using the same method as before for choosing
			the initial conditions. Then I sort these trajectories according to their minimum-L2
			point and select the first N trajectories for inclusion in the dataset. I also take care
			to ensure that the distribution of trajectories across train, validation, and test sets
			is uniform with respect to these minimum points. When we plot the histogram of the
			windows from the dataset, grouping the windows based on their minimum points, we see
			that we've increased the number of windows in each of the groups with a distance from
			the origin {`$\\lt{3}$`}
			by a factor of about 10, while the total number of windows is the same as before:

			Possibly we might continue to see incremental improvements if we continue to increase

			attractor where data is sparse. For many real-world use cases, this behavior could be
			cost prohibitive; for example, in a nuclear fusion reactor, data collection is currently

			loop, leading to larger and larger errors in the output over time? Or does the model remain
			robust to these small input errors and continue to produce plausible trajectories indefinitely?
		</P><P
			>The term "plausible trajectory" needs some explanation, given that, in principle, the
			Lorenz Attractor is fully deterministic, so every trajectory is either a solution of the
			system or it isn't, <i>i.e.</i> there is no notion of the likelihood of a trajectory
			having been produced by the system or not. In practice, however, due to the finite
			precision of numerical computation, IVP solvers also make mistakes, injecting an element
			of stochasticity into the solutions they produce. The <Link
				href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadowing_lemma">shadowing lemma</Link

			to real trajectories so that the final solution can be said to faithfully represent the real

		<H1 id="discussion">Discussion</H1>
		<P
			>This project has probed the potential of the NHiTS neural architecture (<Ref
				id="challu"
			/>) to forecast the dynamics of the Lorenz Attractor, as estimated by the Radau IVP
			solver. Given {`$2H$`}
			points of an initial trajectory, the neural model demonstrated the ability to predict the
			subsequent
			{`$H$`} outputs of the Radau solver with very high accuracy in nearly all regions of the
			attractor's subspace. However, the dynamics in one region, the origin, proved to be too complex
			for the models tested here to capture. In all experiments, as trajectories approach the origin
			along the Z axis, the model's prediction error increases asymptotically. Significant efforts
			to augment the training data distribution in order to over-represent trajectories in this
			region imparted little or no improvement to the model's forecasting ability.</P
		><P
			>Similarly, when used autoregressively, the model demonstrated the potential to generate
			arbitrarily long trajectories that visually and statistically match the typical
			trajectories produced by the Radau solver for nearly all regions. But when the
			trajectories approach too close to the origin, the autoregressive output also breaks
			down, leading to solutions that visibly diverge from typical trajectories in obvious
			ways.
		</P><P
			>As already mentioned, it is well understood from dynamical systems theory that the
			saddle point at the origin of the Lorenz Attractor consists of a stable 2-d manifold and
			a highly unstable 1-d manifold. What this study suggests, and what is possibly not as
			well established, is that the predictability of the Lorenz Attractor largely depends on
			the trajectory's proximity to the origin. Trajectories on the attractor that remain
			sufficiently far from the origin are easily forecast by the model with high
			accuracy&mdash;including the transitions between the orbits around each of the two
			non-origin fixed points. But as trajectories approach the origin, and their velocities
			approach zero, they become asymptotically less predictable in the time period
			immediately before and after their transit past the origin (as the minimum distance to
			the origin decreases, this time period also increases). Fortunately, such trajectories
			appear to occur quite rarely on the attractor; in my experiments, when initial
			conditions are selected randomly from a point within the attractor volume, the
			trajectory has about a 1% chance of passing within a Euclidean distance of 3 or less
			from the origin within its first 150 seconds.
		</P><P
			>Trajectories that manage to pass so closely to the origin share other characteristics
			in common; for example, they are always nearly aligned with the Z axis as they approach
			the origin, and their velocities are dominated by the component in the negative Z
			direction. If we trace their paths back a bit farther, we notice a startling consistency
			among all trajectories with non-trivial sMAPE errors: the local maximum of the Z
			coordinate in the region of the trajectory just prior to approaching the origin
			converges to a value of approximately 38.55. As the model's temporal resolution is
			increased, the bounds on this value become tighter. Remarkably, for Models 2 and 3, <i

			>What can we say about this? It would seem in one sense that the entire predictive

			the Z axis, near 38.55. As long as the local maximum Z coordinate of a trajectory in
			orbit around one of the two non-origin fixed points does not pass through a narrow
			interval around this value, we can be certain (according to the statistics of all of the
			test sets in this study) that the model will forecast the trajectory with a sMAPE error
			less than 5 <i>indefinitely</i>. If a trajectory's peak Z coordinate does pass through
			this interval, then the model has a roughly 60% chance of exhibiting a sMAPE error
			greater than 5 in the period immediately following the peak, until the next peak Z
			coordinate is reached. An obvious next question to ask is, how do we exploit this
			observation to improve predictability? If the system were augmented with a control input
			of some sort, then the target for that control could be to perturb the trajectories so
			that they avoid passing through this critical region around Z {`$\\approx$`} 38.55. The results
			of this study suggest that this alone might make the Lorenz Attractor dynamics entirely predictable.
		</P>
		<P
			>The fact that over-representing such trajectories in the training set by a factor of 10
			did not significantly improve the model's performance on these predictions suggests to
			me that their difficulty stems not from their low occurence in the training set but from
			an asymptotic increase in the sensitivity of the system near the origin. Consider an
			analogy in which all possible trajectories are represented by grooves on a wooden table
			along which a marble can roll, and the origin is a region where all of the grooves
			appear to coalesce so densely that the model lacks the resolution to distinguish among
			them. As the marble proceeds down one groove, it is easily bumped over to another groove
			by the numerical rounding error of the IVP solver, adding an element of pseudo-randomn
			noise to the trajectory.
		</P>
		<P
			>In closing, I will return to the implications of the <Link
				href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadowing_lemma">shadowing lemma</Link
			> and research such as <Ref id="chandramoorthy" /> for the feasibility of training models
			like these to predict real-world chaotic systems. It is well understood, and has been clearly
			demonstrated in this project, that IVP solvers produce imperfect solutions due to numerical
			rounding error. The models trained here, therefore, may be more accurately described as approximations
			of the
			<i>IVP solver</i>
			rather than of the true, mathematical idealization of the Lorenz Attractor represented by
			the ordinary differential equation introduced at the beginning of this study. Although technically
			deterministic, this rounding error introduces a kind of noise in the measurements of the
			system; similarly, any real-world dataset that is collected through environmental sensors
			will undoubtedly contain some amount of noise. While the shadowing lemma suggests that such
			noise may only marginally impact the correlation between the model and the chaotic system,
			<Ref id="chandramoorthy" /> suggests the possibility that it can lead to highly divergent,
			non-physical solutions that may even be drawn from an entirely different system's distribution.
			The feasibility of modeling real-world chaotic systems may therefore hinge on the likelihood
			that a system emits "physical" shadowing solutions. If the likelihood is large enough, and
			especially if the system exhibits such narrow constraints on the conditions that lead to
			chaotically divergent trajectories as have been observed for the Z coordinate in this study,
			then effective control over chaotic dynamics may be tractable.
