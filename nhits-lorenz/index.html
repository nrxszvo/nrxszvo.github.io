			learning to predict or control chaotic dynamical systems, in particular William Gilpin&#39;s
			paper, <i data-svelte-h="svelte-oq8z8z">Model scale versus domain knowledge in statistical forecasting of chaotic systems</i> [<a href="https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.5.043252" class="font-medium text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-500 hover:underline " target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1</a>]. Gilpin found that, given enough training data, generic neural
			architectures can match or exceed the performance of state-of-the-art domain-specific
			chaotic forecasting models such as reservoir computers and neural ODEs. I have recently
			become intrigued by the prospect of applying deep learning to prediction tasks involving
			chaotic systems, as I explore ways to contribute to the efforts to find technical
			solutions to climate change, and Gilpin&#39;s paper provided the impetus for me to begin
			this investigation. Along with [<a href="https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.5.043252" class="font-medium text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-500 hover:underline " target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1</a>], several other recent publications in
			related areas have been especially exciting to me, particularly the ones applying deep
			learning to tokamak control in nuclear fusion reactors (see e.g. [<a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07024-9" class="font-medium text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-500 hover:underline " target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2</a>], [<a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-04301-9" class="font-medium text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-500 hover:underline " target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">3</a>])<sup data-svelte-h="svelte-6x9dc9"><a href="#sabine">1</a></sup>.</p><p class="my-2 indent-8 ">My goal with this project is to get some hands-on experience with a chaotic system and

			non-physics-informed) neural network&#39;s ability to model a single chaotic system (within the
			computational constraints imposed by my budget<sup data-svelte-h="svelte-yuo1gg"><a href="#paperspace">2</a></sup>).
			I&#39;ll start with what is probably the most well known chaotic system, the Lorenz

			at the time of writing, for univariate time series prediction, with up to an order of magnitude

			for a network architecture.</p> <p class="my-2 indent-8 ">The architectural ideas in N-HiTS build on those of its predecessor, N-BEATS [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10437" class="font-medium text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-500 hover:underline " target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">6</a>], a neural basis expansion network for time series prediction.

			and the use of both forecast and backcast predictions from each block. The forecast
			predictions from all blocks are summed together to produce the final output of the
			network, while the backcasts are subtracted from the input of the corresponding block to
			produce a residual connection as the input to the next block. The goal of the backcasts
			is to help the downstream blocks by &quot;removing components of their input that are not
			helpful for forecasting&quot; [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10437" class="font-medium text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-500 hover:underline " target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">6</a>].</p> <p class="my-2 indent-8 ">The novel ideas from N-HiTS enable the possiblity of modeling increasingly long time
			horizons while keeping computational complexity low. They include the use of pooling
			layers that downsample the inputs to each block and upsampling layers that map a
			compressed representation of the forecast to the output sample rate. In addition to the
			complexity savings, the compressed representations may induce a bias towards a temporal
			hierarchical modeling of the time series across the blocks that allows N-HiTS to exceed
			the performance of competing long-horizon forecasting models while requiring an order of
			magnitude lower computational complexity [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.12886" class="font-medium text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-500 hover:underline " target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5</a>].</p> <div id="experiments" class="text-2xl font-bold text-center my-8">Experiments</div> <p class="my-2 indent-8 ">While Gilpin&#39;s experiments focus on testing 24 different time-series prediction models

			parameters for tuning [<a href="https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.5.043252" class="font-medium text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-500 hover:underline " target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1</a>], my experiments aim to tune a single model,
			N-HiTS, on a single system, the Lorenz Attractor, to maximize its accuracy for a given,
			relatively long, fixed horizon (aka prediction window length). And more specifically, I
			aim not only to achieve a low average error on the test set but also to limit the
			worst-case error as much as possible, which will likely mean achieving a degree of
			predictive power over the most chaotic regions of the system. Is this a completely naive
			aspiration given what is known about chaotic systems? Maybe, but I&#39;m not really sure
			yet, and either way this should be a great learning experience...</p><div id="datagen" class="text-xl font-medium text-left mt-8 mb-4">Data Generation</div><p class="my-2 indent-8 ">I begin with a horizon (prediction window), $H$, of 100 points, using a $dt$ of
			approximately
			$0.015$ seconds per point (the default from <a href="https://github.com/williamgilpin/dysts" class="font-medium text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-500 hover:underline " target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dysts</a>) to sample the solution produced by the <a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.integrate.solve_ivp.html" class="font-medium text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-500 hover:underline " target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IVP solver</a>. Importantly, note that this $dt$ is only the one used for sampling the solution
			<i data-svelte-h="svelte-10nlrz4">after</i>
			it is generated by the IVP solver. The actual $dt$ used internally by the IVP solver
			can vary dynamically, but the initial target value used by <a href="https://github.com/williamgilpin/dysts" class="font-medium text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-500 hover:underline " target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dysts</a> is $\approx 1.8\mathrm{e}\text{-}\mathrm{4}$.</p><p class="my-2 indent-8 ">At this stage, it may also be worth mentioning one of the common metrics for measuring

			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyapunov_exponent" class="font-medium text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-500 hover:underline " target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lyapunov exponent</a>.
			As reported in
			<a href="https://github.com/williamgilpin/dysts" class="font-medium text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-500 hover:underline " target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dysts</a>, the Lyapunov exponent, $\lambda_{max}$,
			for the Lorenz Attractor is approx. $0.8917$, and so the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyapunov_time" class="font-medium text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-500 hover:underline " target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lyapunov time</a> is approx.

			the Lorenz Attractor are expected to diverge by a factor of $e$ after
			$1.121$ seconds. Note that with these parameters, the horizon covers a time period of
			about
			$\frac{4}{3}$
			of the Lyapunov time. I can&#39;t say too much about the significance of this yet, other than
			to point out that because the Lyapunov exponent is positive, the distance between any two

			perturbation uniformly sampled from the interval $[0.99,1.01]$.</p> <p class="my-2 indent-0 ">The input to the N-HiTs model is a lookback window of the previous series values whose
			length is typically some multiple of the horizon window. I went with the default value
			from the N-HiTS paper of 5 times the horizon window length, or 500 points, making each
			training sample a total of 600 points. (Note that because N-HiTs is a univariate model,
			while the Lorenz System is three-dimensional, the data points must be flattened into one
			dimension. Therefore, the horizon window length is actually $3*100 = 300$, and each
			training sample&#39;s length is $3 * (500 + 100) = 1800$).</p> <p class="my-2 indent-8 ">I choose, somewhat arbitrarily, to generate 10,000 points per series, and in order to
			increase data efficiency, I select each training sample by sliding the 600-point window
			along the series with a one-point stride. Each series, therefore, contributes $10,000 - 600 +
		1 = 9401$ training samples. For the initial experiment, I generate 25 series with unique initial conditions,

			point coincides with one of the three <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_point_(mathematics)" class="font-medium text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-500 hover:underline " target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">critical points</a> of the Lorenz system—in this case, the origin. And in this parameterization, the
			origin is known to be a saddle point comprised of the intersection of a stable 2D manifold
			and an unstable 1D manifold. &quot;Stable&quot; here means that trajectories near the critical point
			tend to move towards it even if they are perturbed slightly away from it by other forces,
			while &quot;unstable&quot; implies the opposite. (See [<a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/03036758.2018.1434802" class="font-medium text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-500 hover:underline " target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">7</a>] for some excellent visualizations
			of these manifolds.) Near the origin, the unstable manifold is a line that is approximately
			perpendicular to the Z axis and parallel to the lengthwise orientation of the Attractor,
			which is why the trajectories always diverge at the near-90-degree angles that we see in
			the animations as they approach the origin. And the (incredibly complex) topography of the
			stable 2D manifold determines towards which of the other two critical points a trajectory
			will be deflected [<a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/03036758.2018.1434802" class="font-medium text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-500 hover:underline " target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">7</a>]. In fact, we might technically say that the
			primary goal of the neural network is to learn the topography of the origin&#39;s stable 2D
			manifold; according to [<a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/03036758.2018.1434802" class="font-medium text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-500 hover:underline " target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">7</a>], this manifold defines a boundary across
			which trajectories can never pass, so we can confine the past and future path of any
			trajectory based on the boundaries of this manifold.</p><p class="my-2 indent-8 ">We can estimate how unstable the 1D manifold is by calculating the eigenvalues of the
			Jacobian matrix of the system at the origin and assuming the dynamics are approximately
			linear in this region (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hartman%E2%80%93Grobman_theorem" class="font-medium text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-500 hover:underline " target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hartman-Grobman Theorem</a>). When we do this, we get three eigenvalues, two of which have negative real
			components and are associated with the stable 2D manifold, and the third which has
			positive real component and is associated with the unstable 1D manifold. The dynamics
			along the manifolds near the origin can be approximated by the expression $f(t) = \exp(\lambda t)x_0$,
			where $\lambda$ equals the eigenvalue and $x_0$ is some initial point. For the Lorenz
			Attractor, the eigenvalue associated with the unstable manifold is $\approx 11.8$,
			so trajectories will be rapidly deflected away from the origin along the unstable
			manifold, as we see in the below animation:</p> <figure class="mt-6 mb-6 self-center max-w-md"><img class="object-contain" src="../trajectories.gif" alt="trajectories approaching origin" width="500" height="500"> <figcaption class="text-center text-xs mt-2">The trajectories from the training set all begin at nearly the same point but
				quickly diverge as they approach the critical point at the origin.</figcaption></figure> <p class="my-2 indent-8 ">Given all of this background, it is now unsurprising that the model is struggling to
			predict the behavior of the system near the origin. But we should also note that the
			model does quite well at predicting basically every other region of the system. If we
			can figure out a way to improve the predictions near the origin, then we should have a
			model with an overall very robust representation of the Lorenz Attractor. As this model
			and its training set are relatively modest in size, the next most obvious step to try is
			to significantly increase both the amount of training data and the model&#39;s capacity, and

			predictability becomes exponentially more sensitive to error as the trajectories
			approach the origin? Or can we continue to make progress with some new model or training
			strategy?</p> <div id="model-3" class="text-xl font-medium text-left mt-8 mb-4">Model 3</div> <p class="my-2 indent-8 ">With Model 2, we drastically increased both model capacity and dataset size, and we only
			achieved a marginal improvement on the most difficult trajectories. In this round of
			experiments, I will try a couple of new ideas that more specifically target these weak
			areas.</p> <div class="text-lg font-medium text-left ms-4 mt-4 mb-4">3.1: Biased Dataset Distribution</div> <p class="my-2 indent-8 ">The first idea is to increase the percentage of trajectories in the dataset that pass
			very close to the origin so that the model sees more examples of these very tough cases
			during training. This turns out to be quite tricky task! Emperically, trajectories that
			pass very close to the origin are rare on the attractor, in the sense that just choosing
			a random intial condition from a point within the attractor volume is unlikely to
			produce a trajectory that passes very close to the origin in a relatively short amount
			of time. One idea is to choose a point that is already very close to the origin, and
			then use it as the initial condition to generate both a forward- and a backward-time
			solution. Then we can concatenate the two solutions together to produce a single
			solution with adequate time points before and after it approaches the origin. Sounds
			simple enough, except that when I attempted to produce the backwards solution, I
			inevitably ended up with a trajectory whose X coordinate grows in magnitude
			exponentially. In all of my attempts using the <a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.integrate.Radau.html" class="font-medium text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-500 hover:underline " target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Radau solver</a> with error tolerances approaching the limits of double precision, the X coordinate grew
			to the order of about $1\mathrm{e}{30}$
			after about 0.5 seconds.</p><p class="my-2 indent-8 ">What&#39;s going on here? One possible explanation has to do with the finite volume that
			the attractor occupies. When we generate a forward solution starting with a point that
			is already on, or very close to, the attractor, we should be almost guaranteed to end up
			with a trajectory that remains on the attractor as $t \to \infty$, as this is the
			definition of an attractor after all. But the phase space is unbounded, and when we
			generate a backwards time solution, we are choosing a point on some aribtrary trajectory
			from the set of all trajectories in the phase space, including the ones that begin very
			far away from the attractor volume. The probability of randomly selecting a point that
			corresponds with a trajectory that has already been on the attractor for a sufficiently
			long period of time <i data-svelte-h="svelte-ah22qx">might</i> be very low. However, this theory doesn&#39;t seem to
			explain why the X coordinate specifically would explode, while Y and Z remain on the
			attractor. And there are plenty of research papers that analyze backwards time solutions
			to the Lorenz Attractor (<i data-svelte-h="svelte-1yxphdm">e.g.</i>[<a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/03036758.2018.1434802" class="font-medium text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-500 hover:underline " target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">7</a>]), so clearly it is possible to
			generate backwards time solutions, I just have not been able to determine how. Possibly
			there is some issue with the numerical stability of the approaches I tried.</p><p class="my-2 indent-8 ">Failing to employ the backwards-time method, I will resort to cruder methods for
			generating a biased dataset. First I generate a very large number of trajectories (many
			more than I intend to use during training) using the same method as before for choosing
			the initial conditions. Then I sort these trajectories according to their minimum-L2
			point and select the first N trajectories for inclusion in the dataset. I also take care
			to ensure that the distribution of trajectories across train, validation, and test sets
			is uniform with respect to these minimum points. When we plot the histogram of the
			windows from the dataset, grouping the windows based on their minimum points, we see
			that we&#39;ve increased the number of windows in each of the groups with a distance from
			the origin $\lt{3}$
			by a factor of about 10, while the total number of windows is the same as before:</p> <figure class="my-8 self-center max-w-lg"><img class="object-contain" src="../datahist_model_2_v_3.1.png" alt="Dataset distribution for Model 2 vs. 3"><figcaption class="text-center text-xs mt-2">Distribution of windows in the dataset based on minimum distance from the origin
				for Model 2 and Model 3.1.</figcaption></figure> <p>Still, with these 10x increases, the trajectories that pass within an L2 distance $\le{5}$
			from the origin only comprise about 1.5% of the dataset (compared to 0.5% for the previous
			dataset). The other 98.5% is composed of what we already know to be easy cases for the model
			to predict.</p> <p class="my-2 indent-8 ">When we retrain the model using this dataset, we see a very slight improvement on the
			toughest cases. The error curve still increases asymptotically as the trajectory minima
			approach the origin, but it&#39;s also shifted slightly to the left:</p> <figure class="mt-2 mb-2 self-center max-w-3xl"><img class="object-contain" src="../Model2v3.1-DFO.png" alt="Model 2 vs. 3.1 - distance from origin vs. sMAPE"><figcaption class="text-center text-xs mt-2">With 10x more samples of the most difficult trajectories in its dataset, Model 3.1
				makes very marginal improvements over Model 2.</figcaption></figure> <p class="my-2 indent-8 ">Possibly we might continue to see incremental improvements if we continue to increase
			the percentage of the dataset that is comprised of these tough cases, but regardless,
			there seems to be a troubling trend emerging. The model does not appear to be
			extrapolating the dynamics of the system to this particular, small region of the
			attractor where data is sparse. For many real-world use cases, this behavior could be
			cost prohibitive; for example, in a nuclear fusion reactor, data collection is currently
			relatively expensive, and a severe failure can badly damage the reactor, leading to
			massive repair costs. Therefore, we should explore strategies other than increasing
			dataset size to address this problem first.</p> <div class="text-lg font-medium text-left ms-4 mt-4 mb-4">3.2: Reduced $dt$</div> <p class="my-2 indent-8 ">The next idea is to increase the temporal resolution of the model by using a smaller $dt$
			to generate the data points. So far I&#39;ve used a $dt$ of $\approx0.015$. Here
			I&#39;ll try reducing that by a factor of 5 to $\approx0.003$, and in order to keep the
			prediction task equally difficult, I&#39;ll also increase the horizon window by a factor of
			5 to 500 so that the total amount of time being predicted is still $\approx1.5$
			seconds. From tuning, I found that an input size of $2H$ performs just as well as an
			input size of $5H$, so I&#39;ll only increase the input size to 1000. I&#39;ll also use the
			same method as with 3.1 for generating a biased dataset, this time with 50,000 points

			to be just a hair under 16 GB. This also means that the model trains significantly more slowly,
			taking about 36 hours to converge, compared to about 16 hours for Model 2.</p> <p class="mt-4">After retraining with $dt \approx 0.003$, we again see a very slight improvement
			over the previous models:</p> <figure class="mb-8 self-center max-w-3xl"><img class="object-contain" src="../Model3.2-DFO.png" alt="Model 3.2 - distance-from-origin error distribution"><figcaption class="text-center text-xs mt-2">With 10x more samples of the most difficult trajectories and 5x the temporal

			might lead to a fully stable model (<i data-svelte-h="svelte-1xx6z5c">i.e.</i> one without an asymptotic error curve). And
			reducing it further will drastically increase the computational requirements of training,

			used auto-regressively to generate a trajectory of arbitrary length given only the first $L$
			samples of the reference trajectory, where $L$ is the input size of the model. This test
			can measure another aspect of the stability of the model: if the model produces small errors
			in its output that are then fed back to its input, do these errors compound in the feedback
			loop, leading to larger and larger errors in the output over time? Or does the model remain
			robust to these small input errors and continue to produce plausible trajectories indefinitely?</p><p class="my-2 indent-8 ">The term &quot;plausible trajectory&quot; needs some explanation, given that, in principle, the
			Lorenz Attractor is fully deterministic, so every trajectory is either a solution of the
			system or it isn&#39;t, <i data-svelte-h="svelte-1xx6z5c">i.e.</i> there is no notion of the likelihood of a trajectory
			having been produced by the system or not. In practice, however, due to the finite
			precision of numerical computation, IVP solvers also make mistakes, injecting an element
			of stochasticity into the solutions they produce. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadowing_lemma" class="font-medium text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-500 hover:underline " target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shadowing lemma</a> tells us that, in spite of these errors, these &quot;pseudo orbits&quot; remain arbitrarily close
			to real trajectories so that the final solution can be said to faithfully represent the real
			trajectories of the system. However, some studies, <i data-svelte-h="svelte-1yxphdm">e.g.</i> [<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcp.2021.110389" class="font-medium text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-500 hover:underline " target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">8</a>], challenge this notion, demonstrating that in certain cases
			the statistics of the solver&#39;s outputs are distinct from those of true solutions of the
			system, and they can even imply a different parameterization of the underlying system.
			These are quite troubling implications for real-world applications, but I will delay
			further examination of this topic until the Discussion section.</p><p class="my-2 indent-8 ">In light of this, rather than evaluating the difference between the solver output and
			the model output, a more meaningful criterion may be to measure the similarity between
			certain statistics of their outputs. In [<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcp.2021.110389" class="font-medium text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-500 hover:underline " target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">8</a>], the following

			solutions:</p>
\begin{align}
\operatorname{J}(z) := exp(-\frac{z^2}{2}) \\

			spend more time at Z coordinates very close to the origin as well as getting closer to
			the origin (minimum coordinate of $z \approx 0.4$ for the solver compared to $z \approx 1.35$
			for the model). It&#39;s worth noting that the distributions of this metric for the other two
			coordinates, X and Y, match almost perfectly between the model and the solver.</p> <p class="my-2 indent-8 ">In we inspect them visually, we find that the vast majority of trajectories produced by
			the model look entirely plausible, possibily even indistinguishable to the human eye

			another high-quality IVP solver. Ultimately, all three systems diverge chaotically from
			each other, but in the short term, Model 3 remains closer to Radau than RK45.</p> <div id="discussion" class="text-2xl font-bold text-center my-8">Discussion</div> <p class="my-2 indent-8 ">This project has probed the potential of the NHiTS neural architecture ([<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.12886" class="font-medium text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-500 hover:underline " target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5</a>]) to forecast the dynamics of the Lorenz Attractor, as estimated by the Radau IVP
			solver. Given $2H$
			points of an initial trajectory, the neural model demonstrated the ability to predict the
			subsequent
			$H$ outputs of the Radau solver with very high accuracy in nearly all regions of the
			attractor&#39;s subspace. However, the dynamics in one region, the origin, proved to be too complex
			for the models tested here to capture. In all experiments, as trajectories approach the origin
			along the Z axis, the model&#39;s prediction error increases asymptotically. Significant efforts
			to augment the training data distribution in order to over-represent trajectories in this
			region imparted little or no improvement to the model&#39;s forecasting ability.</p><p class="my-2 indent-8 ">Similarly, when used autoregressively, the model demonstrated the potential to generate
			arbitrarily long trajectories that visually and statistically match the typical
			trajectories produced by the Radau solver for nearly all regions. But when the
			trajectories approach too close to the origin, the autoregressive output also breaks
			down, leading to solutions that visibly diverge from typical trajectories in obvious
			ways.</p><p class="my-2 indent-8 ">As already mentioned, it is well understood from dynamical systems theory that the
			saddle point at the origin of the Lorenz Attractor consists of a stable 2-d manifold and
			a highly unstable 1-d manifold. What this study suggests, and what is possibly not as
			well established, is that the predictability of the Lorenz Attractor largely depends on
			the trajectory&#39;s proximity to the origin. Trajectories on the attractor that remain
			sufficiently far from the origin are easily forecast by the model with high
			accuracy—including the transitions between each of the two lobes. But as
			trajectories approach the origin, and their velocities approach zero, they become
			asymptotically less predictable in the time period immediately before and after their
			transit past the origin (as the minimum distance to the origin decreases, this time
			period also increases). Fortunately, such trajectories appear to occur quite rarely on
			the attractor; in my experiments, when initial conditions are selected randomly from a
			point within the attractor volume, the trajectory has about a 1% chance of passing
			within a Euclidean distance of 3 or less from the origin within its first 150 seconds.</p><p class="my-2 indent-8 ">Trajectories that manage to pass so closely to the origin share other characteristics
			in common; for example, they are always nearly aligned with the Z axis as they approach
			the origin, and their velocities are dominated by the component in the negative Z
			direction. If we trace their paths back a bit farther, we notice a startling consistency
			among all trajectories with non-trivial sMAPE errors: the local maximum of the Z
			coordinate in the region of the trajectory just prior to approaching the origin
			converges to a value of approximately $38.55$. As the model&#39;s temporal resolution is
			increased, the bounds on this value become tighter. For Models 2 and 3, a trajectory
			having a local maximum Z coordinate in the range of $38.45$ to $38.6$
			is a necessary condition for the model&#39;s sMAPE error to exceed 5 in the time period immediately
			following its transit past the origin<sup data-svelte-h="svelte-1m8nv3a"><a href="#outliers">1</a></sup>.</p> <figure class="mb-6 self-center"><div class="flex flex-wrap justify-center" data-svelte-h="svelte-lbdos2"><img class="object-contain w-full max-w-xl" src="../max_z.png" alt="Model 3 - maxium Z coordinate error distribution"> <img class="object-contain w-full max-w-xl" src="../max_z_zoomed.png" alt="maximum Z coordinate error distribution zoomed"></div> <figcaption class="text-center text-xs mt-2">The local maximum Z coordinate of trajectories and their maximum sMAPE error in the

			and formulated the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_system#Connection_to_tent_map" class="font-medium text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-500 hover:underline " target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lorenz Map</a> to study the patterns. The map is shown below for Model 3.2&#39;s test set. The x coordinate
			at the transition point of the map (vertical dotted red line) corresponds almost perfectly
			with the limit suggested by the above error plots, about $38.55$. And the y
			coordinate that gives the best fit (minimum classification error) for separating
			trajectories that switch lobes at the end of the current orbital cycle from those that
			remain on the same lobe for at least another orbital cycle (horizontal dotted red line)
			also corresponds almost perfectly with this value. In other words, the most difficult
			trajectories for our models to predict are the ones that a) achieve the near-maximum
			observed Z coordinate (approximately 48) after passing by the origin, and b) straddle
			the threshold between transitioning from one lobe to the other or remaining on the
			current lobe for at least another orbital cycle.</p> <figure class="mb-4 self-center max-w-2xl"><img class="object-contain" src="../Lorenz_map.png" alt="Lorenz Map"> <figcaption class="text-center text-xs mt-2">The Lorenz Map computed from the test set used with Model 3.2. It plots the $n$th

				and those that remain on the same lobe for at least one more orbital cycle. The vertical
				red line marks the estimated point at which the map&#39;s derivative switches from positive
				to negative. For both lines, the computed value is approximately $38.55$, in
				near perfect agreement with the statistic for predicting large sMAPE errors.</figcaption></figure> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-byv5j9">This makes perfect sense. The trajectories that are the most difficult for the model to
			predict are the ones for which the tiniest perturbation can determine whether it
			transitions to the other lobe or remains on the current lobe. Finally, we have a concise
			way to describe the complexity of this prediction task. For the vast majority of
			trajectories, their transition probability is deterministic, either 100% or 0%, based
			solely on their Z coordinate local maximum. But there is a very narrow region of Z
			coordinates where the transition probability suddenly shifts to closer to 50%.</p> <figure class="my-2 self-center max-w-2xl"><img class="object-contain" src="../Lorenz_map_transition.png" alt="Lorenz Map transitions"> <figcaption class="text-center text-xs mt-2">A close-up of the threshold region between trajectories that switch lobes (orange)

				coordinate local maximum.</figcaption></figure> <p class="my-2 indent-8 ">It would seem in one sense that the entire predictive complexity of the Lorenz
			Attractor is converging towards this Z value around $38.55$. As long as the local
			maximum Z coordinate of the trajectory does not pass through a narrow interval around
			this value, we can be certain (according to the statistics of all of the test sets in
			this study) that the model will continue to forecast the trajectory with a sMAPE error
			less than 5. If a trajectory does pass through this interval, then the model has a
			roughly 60% chance of exhibiting a sMAPE error greater than 5 in the period immediately
			following the peak, until the next local maximum Z coordinate is reached. How might we
			exploit this observation to improve predictability? If the system were augmented with a
			control input, then the target for that control could be to perturb the trajectories so
			that they avoid passing through this critical region around Z $\approx 38.55$. The
			results of this study suggest that this alone might make the dynamics of the Lorenz
			Attractor practically predictable.</p> <p class="my-2 indent-8 ">Is this subtle inconsistency, in which the local Z maximum determines whether a
			transition will occur for all but a tiny range of values, an inherent property of the
			Lorenz Attractor, or could it somehow be a byproduct of the rounding error in the IVP
			solver? I don&#39;t know (please let me know if you do!), but if it&#39;s the former, then I
			would argue that this seems to impart a stochastic quality to the Lorenz Attractor that
			is incongruous with what we know to otherwise be a deterministic system. And if it&#39;s the
			latter, then we must ask how might the model would perform on a dataset in which the
			local Z maximum <i data-svelte-h="svelte-1ejn32g">is</i> linearly separable between these two groups, assuming we could
			somehow generate one? In this case, we would expect that the model&#39;s predictions for the
			toughest test cases, although they still might higher than average error, would at least
			not waiver indecisively between the two lobes, as they do now, but would instead commit to
			the correct lobe 100% of the time.</p> <p class="my-4 text-sm font-serif bg-gray-100 rounded border ring-1 ring-black p-2"><b data-svelte-h="svelte-94l0jb">Sidenote:</b> Upon discovering this apparent stochastic quality in the trajectories,
			I ran some follow-up experiments to see if I could generate such a dataset by using a
			smaller $dt$
			parameter in the IVP solver. I tried values of $dt$ in the range $[1.8\mathrm{e}\text{-}\mathrm{4}, 1.8\mathrm{e}\text{-}\mathrm{5}]$.
			In all cases, the IVP solver eventually produced a trajectory that violated the linear
			separability requirement for the local Z maximum, and at $1.8\mathrm{e}\text{-}\mathrm{5}$,
			the numerical stability of the solver appeared to break down.</p> <p class="my-2 indent-8 ">In closing, I will touch again on the implications of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadowing_lemma" class="font-medium text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-500 hover:underline " target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shadowing lemma</a> and research such as [<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcp.2021.110389" class="font-medium text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-500 hover:underline " target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">8</a>] for the feasibility of training models
			like these to predict real-world chaotic systems. It is well understood, and has been clearly
			demonstrated in this project, that IVP solvers produce imperfect solutions due to numerical
			rounding error. The models trained here, therefore, may be more accurately described as approximations
			of the
			<i data-svelte-h="svelte-17gf2g4">IVP solver</i>
			rather than of the true, mathematical idealization of the Lorenz Attractor represented by
			the ordinary differential equation introduced at the beginning of this study. Although technically
			deterministic, this rounding error introduces a kind of noise in the measurements of the
			system; similarly, any real-world dataset that is collected through environmental sensors
			will undoubtedly contain some amount of noise. While the shadowing lemma suggests that such
			noise may only marginally impact the correlation between the model and the chaotic system,
			[<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcp.2021.110389" class="font-medium text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-500 hover:underline " target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">8</a>] suggests the possibility that it can lead to highly divergent,
			non-physical solutions that may even be drawn from an entirely different system&#39;s distribution.
			The feasibility of modeling real-world chaotic systems may therefore hinge on the likelihood
			that a system emits &quot;physical&quot; shadowing solutions. If the likelihood is large enough, and
			especially if the system exhibits such narrow constraints on the conditions that lead to
			chaotically divergent trajectories as have been observed for the Z coordinate in this study,
			then effective control over chaotic dynamics may be tractable.</p> <div class="my-4 ms-4 -indent-4 font-serif leading-4"><p><sup id="outliers">1. Note the handful of anomalous points on the far left of the first graph whose
